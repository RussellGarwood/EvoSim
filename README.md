2. INTRODUCTION

REVOSIM is an evolutionary model that aims to bridge the epistemological
gap between micro- and macro-evolution; by providing an organism-level
simulation of sufficient computational efficiency that population sizes
of 10*5-10*6 individuals can be studied over geological timescales. The
model also incorporates concepts of spatial relationships, spatial and
temporal environmental variation, and recombinant reproduction. Isolation
of gene-pools (i.e. speciation) is not enforced, but emerges naturally
from simulations under appropriate conditions. We intend REVOSIM as a
multipurpose platform for the study of many evolutionary phenomena; while
it was designed with macro-evolutionary studies in mind, it is also
applicable to micro-evolutionary problems.
