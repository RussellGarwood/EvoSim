The first four (“Run”, “Run for”, “Batch”, and “Stop”) control the initiation and cessation of simulation runs. These commands can also be accessed from the “Command” menu. Further detail on these actions can be found in 3.3.1 and 3.3.2.

The fifth and sixth buttons (“Reset” and “Reseed”) allow the resetting of the simulation and reseeding of the initial genomes in the population window prior to running a simulation. Further detail on these actions can be found in 3.3.3 and 3.3.4.

The next three buttons (“Organism”, “Simulation”, and “Output”) open/close the settings panels of the same name.

The final button (“About”) displays the programme information; including version number, authors, license information.
